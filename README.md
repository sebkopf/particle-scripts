# Collection of scripts for particle (former spark) core/photon

This is a collection of code snippets for particle (formerly spark) hardware like the core, photon and electron. They are just small but hopefully useful examples that are not quite elaborate enough to really merit extraction into an individual library. Many are not cleaned up but will hopefully come online as I find time.

## Scripts

 - [Example for logging data straight to google spreadsheet]("gs_logging")


## Other notes

- [Photon setup]("photon_setup.md")
